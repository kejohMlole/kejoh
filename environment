                    <p>Land resources mean the resources available from the land, thus the agricultural<br> land which contain natural fertilizer for growth of the products sown; the <br>underground water, the various minerals like coal, bauxite, gold and other raw materials.<br> <ul>
                        <li>The more a country is able to locate and use the raw materials, the more the industrialization of that country, area etc.</li>
                        </ul> <br>
                        Land resource refers to the land available for exploitation, like non agricultural <br>lands for buildings, developing townships etc.<br> <br>
                        Land resources (natural resources) (economically referred to as land or raw materials) <br>occur naturally within environments that exist relatively undisturbed by<br> mankind, in a natural form.

                    <p>Agricultural land resources are the land areas that are used for growing crops and raising livestock for <br>food, fibre, and fuel. They are essential for the food security, livelihood, and income of millions of <br>people around the world. Agricultural land resources include arable land, permanent <br>crops, permanent pastures, and fallow land.</p>
                    <br>
                    <u><h3>2. Forest Land:</h3></u>

                    <p>Urban land resources are the land areas that are used for various purposes in urban settings, such as <br>settlements, infrastructure, industries, and recreation. They are important for the economic, social, and <br>environmental development of cities and towns, as they provide space for housing, commerce, <br>education, health, and other services that improve the quality of life of urban residents. However, urban <br>land resources also face many challenges, such as scarcity, high cost, pollution, degradation, and <br>conflict. Therefore, urban land resources need to be managed in a sustainable and equitable way that <br>balances the needs and interests of different stakeholders and preserves the ecological functions of <br>urban ecosystems.

                    <p>Wilderness land resource is the land area that is covered with natural vegetation and wildlife that has <br>been largely undisturbed by modern human development1. Wilderness land resource usually lacks roads, buildings,<br> and other artificial structures. It provides a natural environment for plant and animal<br> species, and allows scientists to study healthy ecosystems2. Wilderness land resource can be found in <br>every ecosystem, on every continent, and can vary in size and location.Wilderness land resource is<br> important for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, as well as for the provision <br>of various goods and services for humans, such as wood, food, medicine, climate regulation, water purification,<br> soil protection, recreation, tourism, education, and research.</p>

                    <p> is the process of regulating the use of land by a central authority. Usually, this is done to promote<br> more desirable social and environmental outcomes as well as a more efficient use of resources. More specifically,<br> the goals of modern land use planning often include environmental conservation, restraint of<br> urban sprawl, minimization of transport costs, prevention of land use conflicts, and a reduction in exposure<br> to pollutants. In the pursuit of these goals, planners assume that regulating the use of land will<br> change the patterns of human behavior, and that these changes are beneficial. The first assumption, that<br> regulating land use changes the patterns of human behavior is widely accepted.<br> However, the second assumption - that these changes are beneficial - is contested, and depends on the<br> location and regulations being discussed.

                    <p>In urban planning, land use planning seeks to order and regulate land use in an efficient and ethical way, thus preventing<br>land use conflicts. Governments use land use planning to manage the development of land within their jurisdictions.<br> In doing so, the governmental unit can plan for the needs of the community while safeguarding natural resources.<br> To this end, it is the systematic assessment of land and water potential, alternatives for land use, and economic and<br> social conditions in order to select and adopt the best land use options. Often one element of<br> a comprehensive plan, a land use plan provides a vision for the future possibilities of development in <br>neighborhoods, districts, cities, or any defined planning area.

                    <h2><u>Types of planning:</u></h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Various types of planning have emerged over the course of the 20th century. Below are the six main typologies of planning, <br>as defined by David Walters in his book, <b>Designing Communities</b> (2007):
                    </p><ul><li><b>Traditional or comprehensive planning</b>: Common in the US after World War II, characterized by politically <br>neutral experts with a rational view of the new urban development. Focused on producing clear statements<br> about the form and content of new development.</li>
                        <li><b>Systems planning</b>: 1950s–1970s, resulting from the failure of comprehensive planning to deal with the unforeseen<br> growth of post World War II America. More analytical view of the planning area as a set of complex <br>processes, less interested in a physical plan.</li>
                        <li><b>Democratic planning</b>: 1960s. Result of societal loosening of class and race barriers. Gave more citizens a voice<br> in planning for future of community.</li>
                        <li><b>Advocacy and equity planning</b>:</a> 1960s &amp; 70s. Strands of democratic planning that sought specifically to address<br> social issues of inequality and injustice in community planning.</li>
                        <li><b>Strategic planning</b>: 1960s-present. Recognizes small-scale objectives and pragmatic real-world constraints.</li>
                        <li><b>Environmental planning</b>: 1960s-present. Developed as many of the ecological and social implications of global development were first widely understood.</li></ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>Today, successful planning involves a balanced mix of analysis of the existing conditions and constraints; extensive public engagement; practical planning and design; and financially and politically feasible strategies for implementation.
                        Current processes include a combination of strategic and environmental planning. It is becoming more widely understood that any sector of land has a certain capacity for supporting human, animal, and vegetative life in harmony, and that upsetting this balance has dire consequences on the environment. Planners and citizens often take on an advocacy role during the planning process in an attempt to influence public policy.
                        Since the 1990s, the activist/environmentalist says approach to planning has grown into the Smart Growth movement, characterized by the focus on more sustainable and less environmentally damaging forms of development. Moreover, there is changes on the requirements of land use planning overtime. For example, whilst most of the urban planners suggest the distance from the landfill that a housing estate should be built, they must also take wind direction into consideration 
                        Smart growth supports the integration of mixed land uses into communities as a critical component of achieving better places to live. Putting uses in close proximity to one another has benefits for transportation alternatives to driving, security, community cohesiveness, local economies, and general quality of life issues. Smart growth strives to provide a means for communities to alter the planning context which currently renders mixed land uses illegal in most of the country.

                    <p>Land conservation is the process of protecting natural land and returning developed land to its natural<br> state. Land conservation is important for many reasons, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It preserves and restores ecosystems, which are the communities of living and non-living things that<br> interact with each other and their environment. Ecosystems provide many goods and services for humans and other<br> species, such as food, water, air, climate regulation, soil formation, nutrient cycling,<br> pollination, pest control, and recreation.</li>&nbsp;
                        <li>It conserves biodiversity, which is the variety of life on Earth. Biodiversity is essential for the <br>functioning of ecosystems and the adaptation of species to changing conditions. Biodiversity also has intrinsic value,<br> meaning that it is valuable in itself simply by existing.</li>&nbsp;
                        <li>It enhances the quality of life of humans, as natural land offers opportunities for health, education,<br> culture, and spirituality. Natural land also has aesthetic value, meaning that it is pleasing to the senses and the mind.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <u><p><h3>Some <b>sustainable practices</b> that can help achieve land conservation are:</h3></p></u>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Preservation:</b> It is the practice of keeping land in its natural state and preventing any human use or<br> disturbance. Preservation protects land from degradation and maintains its ecological integrity.</li>&nbsp;
                        <li><b>Restoration:</b> It is the practice of returning degraded land to its original or desired condition. Restoration<br> improves the structure, function, and diversity of ecosystems.</li>&nbsp;
                        <li><b>Remediation:</b> It is the practice of cleaning up contaminated land and reducing or eliminating the harmful effects of<br> pollutants. Remediation reduces the risks to human health and the environment.</li>&nbsp;
                        <li><b>Mitigation:</b> It is the practice of compensating for the loss or damage of natural land by creating or enhancing similar land<br> elsewhere. Mitigation offsets the negative impacts of development on ecosystems.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <u><p><h3>Some <b>benefits</b> of land conservation are:</h3></p></u>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Economic:</b> Land conservation can generate income and employment opportunities through ecotourism, recreation,<br> education, research, and sustainable use of natural resources. Land conservation can also save costs by reducing <br>the need for artificial infrastructure and services that replace ecosystem functions.</li>&nbsp;
                        <li><b>Social:</b> Land conservation can improve human well-being by providing physical and mental health benefits, enhancing<br> social cohesion and equity, fostering cultural identity and diversity, and increasing environmental awareness and stewardship.</li>&nbsp;
                        <li><b>Environmental:</b> Land conservation can mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sequestration.<br> Land conservation can also adapt to climate change by increasing the resilience of ecosystems and <br>species to cope with disturbances and changes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Land conservation is a vital practice that can benefit humans and nature in many ways. By applying sustainable practices and recognizing the value<br> of natural land, we can protect our planet for ourselves and future generations.</p>
